  <h1>Privacy Policy for QuickMove</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, school, profile photo, location (with permission), task history, payment activity, and user ratings.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used to operate the QuickMove platform, including task matching, live tracking for Doers, secure payment handling, fraud prevention, and improving app performance. It also supports features like QuickStrike points and in-app moderation.</p>

  <h2>3. Task Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
  <p>Tasks that are unclaimed for an extended period (typically 90 minutes) may be automatically canceled and refunded to the original Giver’s payment method. Refunds are processed through Stripe and may take several business days to reflect, depending on your payment provider.</p>

  <h2>4. One-Task Limit Policy</h2>
  <p>To ensure fairness and task reliability, QuickMove enforces a one-task-at-a-time policy for Doers. Users may only have one active or in-progress task at a time.</p>

  <h2>5. QuickStrike Points</h2>
  <p>Users may earn QuickStrike points for completing tasks successfully. These points are tied to your account and may be used for future features such as reputation boosts, perks, or in-app rewards. Points have no cash value and may be adjusted or removed in cases of misuse.</p>

  <h2>6. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. Information is only shared with trusted third-party providers (such as Stripe for payments and Firebase for infrastructure) or if legally required.</p>

  <h2>7. Location Services</h2>
  <p>QuickMove uses location data solely for task-related purposes—such as matching nearby users, providing real-time Doer tracking, and supporting accurate arrival updates. Location access is required only when a Doer has accepted a task. You may update your permission settings at any time via your device’s OS.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party SDKs & Tracking</h2>
  <p>QuickMove does not use your personal information for tracking, advertising, or profiling. Some integrated third-party SDKs (such as Firebase and Stripe) may collect basic diagnostics or usage data for security and performance purposes only.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard encryption and secure infrastructure—including Firebase Authentication and Stripe Connect—to store and process your data securely.</p>

  <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request access to, update, or delete your personal data at any time by contacting us at <strong>support@quickmoveapp.com</strong>. We aim to respond within 7 business days.</p>

  <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>QuickMove is intended for users aged 17 and up. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 17. If we discover such data, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>12. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in features, legal requirements, or service providers. The latest version will always be accessible on this page.</p>

  <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, contact us at <strong>support@quickmoveapp.com</strong>.</p>
