  <h1>QuickMove Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 17 years old to use QuickMove. By signing up, you agree to provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date account information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and all activity conducted under your account.</p>

  <h2>2. Task Posting & Acceptance</h2>
  <p>Givers are responsible for posting clear, lawful, and truthful task descriptions. Doers agree to complete accepted tasks to the best of their ability, on time, and with respect for other users. QuickMove reserves the right to moderate or remove any task that violates these terms, community standards, or local laws.</p>

  <h2>3. One-Task Limit</h2>
  <p>To ensure fairness and task reliability, each Doer may only claim and work on one task at a time. Attempting to bypass this limitation through multiple accounts or coordinated manipulation may result in suspension.</p>

  <h2>4. Payments & Fees</h2>
  <p>All payments are securely processed via Stripe. QuickMove may apply a small platform fee to each transaction to support maintenance, moderation, and fraud prevention. By using the platform, you agree to Stripe’s <a href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank">terms of service</a>.</p>

  <h2>5. Refunds and Task Expiration</h2>
  <p>Tasks that remain unclaimed for more than 90 minutes may be automatically canceled and refunded to the Giver’s original payment method. Refunds are issued through Stripe and may take several business days depending on your bank. QuickMove reserves the right to determine refund eligibility on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <h2>6. Disputes and Resolution</h2>
  <p>If a task is completed unsatisfactorily or not at all, users must report the issue within 24 hours of task completion. QuickMove will review the situation and may issue a refund or penalty based on the available evidence. Repeated abuse of the dispute system may lead to account suspension.</p>

  <h2>7. QuickStrike Points</h2>
  <p>Users may earn QuickStrike points by completing tasks, maintaining high ratings, or achieving specific milestones. Points may be used for in-app rewards or future features, but they do not have monetary value and cannot be redeemed for cash. Abuse or manipulation of the points system is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <h2>8. Ratings & Reviews</h2>
  <p>After each task, users may rate each other and provide feedback. QuickMove does not alter or censor reviews except in cases of harassment, fraud, or language that violates our community guidelines.</p>

  <h2>9. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>You agree not to engage in fraud, impersonation, harassment, or actions that compromise the safety of others or the integrity of the platform. Any attempt to bypass platform logic, fees, or restrictions may result in immediate account termination.</p>

  <h2>10. Data & Privacy</h2>
  <p>We collect only the data necessary to provide our services. This includes name, email, phone number, task details, and payment history. Please see our <a href="YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL_HERE">Privacy Policy</a> for a full breakdown. We do not sell your data.</p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may delete your account at any time. QuickMove reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account for violations of these terms, suspicious activity, or by legal request.</p>

  <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, branding, and software associated with QuickMove are the intellectual property of the company. You may not reproduce, copy, or use our materials without written permission.</p>

  <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>QuickMove is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee task outcomes, user conduct, or uninterrupted service. By using the app, you agree that QuickMove is not responsible for direct or indirect damages resulting from use of the platform or any task interaction.</p>

  <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state or country in which QuickMove operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

  <h2>15. Arbitration</h2>
  <p>In the event of a legal dispute that cannot be resolved through informal channels, both parties agree to binding arbitration instead of litigation, except where prohibited by law.</p>

  <h2>16. Updates to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms of Service as the platform evolves. Users will be notified of major changes via email or in-app notice. Continued use of QuickMove constitutes acceptance of any updated terms.</p>

  <h2>17. Contact</h2>
